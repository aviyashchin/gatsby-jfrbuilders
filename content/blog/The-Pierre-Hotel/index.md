description: This pied-Ã -terre in the Pierre Hotel, crafted by J.F. Roesemann Builders, shines with rich and varied textures.  Custom plaster crown mouldings elevate the rooms, Venetian Plaster walls create warmth and high-gloss cabinetry pops with a bold cherry color. This project was brought to fruition by an all-female management and design team.   Our direct and open communication with the Brazil-based design team and client made this project run smoothly to create an international home away from home. This is one of several custom homes we have recently created for internationally based clients.

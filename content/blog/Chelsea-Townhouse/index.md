description: This New York townhouse built in the 1800s was fully renovated by J.F. Roesemann Builders. The renovation included substantial structural improvements including steel columns from the footing to the new rooftop terrace, pumpable grout to reinforce the separating withes of brick, and steel framing for new mechanical systems and rooftop garden access.  The residence included the addition of an elevator and a new stair from the basement to fourth floor.  Care was taken to align the home with Passive House standards, including the use of sprayfoam insulation for sound and temperature barrier, fresh air intake systems on the modern mechanical system, a high efficient boiler and custom insulated windows. Along with these systems improvements, the home was outfitted with period-inspired millwork, custom oak wood floors, LED lighting and inviting finishes throughout.

description: J.F. Roesemann Builders has had the privilege of working on this fine home for the past three Owners. We performed extensive renovations with Eric Smith Architects for the Getty family and later with the decorator Howard Slatkin. This historical home was restored from a multifamily back to the originally designed single family home, creating a true oasis in the center of New Yorkâ€™s Upper East Side. J.F. Roesemann Builders continues to provide the Owner maintenance and care to this historical landmarked home.

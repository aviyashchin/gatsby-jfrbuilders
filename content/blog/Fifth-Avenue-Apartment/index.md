description: Globally renowned architect Eugene Kohn of Kohn, Peterson, Fox Associates asked us to perform a full renovation of their new Fifth Avenue apartment.  This was a second residence renovated for Eugene Kohn with Michael McCaffery Architects.  The Owners developed a design concept focused on quality materials and clean, contemporary details to complement their art and furniture collection. The three bedroom, three bathroom apartment features refurbished original wood floors, custom plaster moldings, marble bathrooms and handmade rice paper wall coverings.  Behind these beautiful finishes the home was updated with new high-performance Landmark windows, LED art lighting, a new electrical service, and mechanical systems.  Updates to the bones of the apartment coupled with the elegant new finishes transformed this pre-war apartment into a modern park-side haven.

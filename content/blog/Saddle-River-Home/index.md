description: A full renovation of this estate shifted the way the Owner walked through the world. He now focused on crown mouldings, baseboard, and other home details previously invisible to his eye. Our extensive renovation included a custom three-room wine cellar and tasting room, custom millwork, new stairs, windows, wood flooring, and mechanical systems throughout the home. Following this renovation, J.F. Roesemann Builders also built a ground up guesthouse on the property. We have since renovated a two-bedroom for the next generation of this family in Tribeca, New York.

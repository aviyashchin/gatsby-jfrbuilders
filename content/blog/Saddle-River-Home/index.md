description: A full renovation of this estate shifted the way the Owner walks through the world. He now focuses on architectural details like crown mouldings and baseboard previously invisible to his eye. Our extensive renovation introduced new character to this space through architectural millwork, custom flooring, lighting systems and stonework. A particularly interesting feature was the creation of a three-chamber temperature controlled wine cellar and adjacent tasting room. Following this renovation, J.F. Roesemann Builders converted a pool house into a fully functional guesthouse on the property. We have since renovated a two-bedroom loft for the next generation of this family in Tribeca, New York.

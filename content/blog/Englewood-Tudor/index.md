description: In this historic home J.F. Roesemann Builders transformed an unfinished space into a luxurious Master Suite including Bedroom, Sitting Room, and Bathroom. The Bedroom and Sitting Room are crafted with plaster walls and ceilings, shop finished Mahogany cabinetry and Mahogany detailing throughout. The introduction of a central mechanical system, AV and lighting systems round out the scope of work. The bathroom features a hand carved solid Azul Macauba stone tub and the introduction of a custom curved iron staircase for direct access to the tub from the outdoor pool and spa. Other improvements to the home include the fabrication and installation of custom insulated period specific windows to improve the energy performance of this one hundred year old mansion.
